# hESCNet
"hESCNet" is a metabolic network model specific to human embryonic stem cells, presented in Yousefi et al. (2019) Cell &amp; Bioscience.

Pluripotency is proposed to exist in two different stages: Naive and Primed. Conventional human pluripotent cells are essentially in the primed stage. In recent years, several protocols have claimed to generate naive human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). To the best of our knowledge, none of these protocols is currently recognized as the gold standard method. Here, we showed that, after batch effect removal, the transcriptome data of eight different protocols which supposedly produce naive hESCs are clustered consistently when compared to the primed ones. Next, by integrating transcriptomes of all hESCs obtained by these protocols, we reconstructed "hESCNet", the first metabolic network model representing hESCs.
